#recipes
A learning project for ladies who are studying clojure.

This project is something simple to serve as a practice app. It stores links to recipes and an interface to view/search them. So we can make new healthy recipes for our family and get back to coding. 

## Usage
`make`  
In browser, open file recipemvc.html
